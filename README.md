# React Pizza

- [DEMO LINK](nasytheslayer.github.io/react-pizza/)

## General info
For the test assignment, the primary objective was to develop a web application according to specified requirements. The application was built using modern technologies such as ReactJS 18, React Router v6 for navigation, Axios and Fetch for data fetching from the API, and Prettier for code formatting. Styling was accomplished using CSS-Modules/SCSS to ensure modularity and maintainability.
The API utilized for this project was Mokky.dev, focusing on automotive data. The web application allows users to interact with the interface, browse different car models displayed on maps, view detailed information about each car, edit their properties within the map interface, and create new maps. Additionally, filters and a search functionality were implemented to enhance user convenience.
